Excel Bike Sales Dashboard Project

 Description
This is a Excel-based data analytics exercise that analyzes customer demographics and purchasing behavior related to bike sales. The dataset was downloaded from a public GitHub repository and used for educational purposes. The objective was to clean the data, perform segmentation, and visualize meaningful insights using Excel's analytical features.

 **Note**: This is a guided project using publicly available data. All data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard design steps were executed independently, and the project is permitted for personal portfolio use.

- Created **Sheet2 – Working Sheet** for preprocessing:
  - Standardized values (e.g., "M" to "Married", "F" to "Female").
  - Removed duplicates and trimmed extra spaces.
  - Created **Age Brackets**:
    - *Adolescent*: Age < 31  
    - *Middle Age*: 31–53  
    - *Old*: Age ≥ 54
